# Subject: Shutdowns in the Event of Negative Spot Prices for Renewable Energy Production Sites Under the Feed-in Premium Scheme

Madam, Sir,

You are a party to a Participation Agreement under the Balance Responsible Entity Mechanism Rules, and your perimeter may include production sites benefiting from a feed-in premium (*complément de rémunération*).

Producers under the feed-in premium scheme have a financial incentive—beyond the price signal conveyed by electricity markets—to stop production during periods of negative spot prices. This incentive takes the form of a premium paid under non-production conditions (known as the **“negative price premium”**).

These shutdowns concern a growing number of sites and occur simultaneously across the entire fleet operating under the feed-in premium scheme. RTE recently highlighted in the *2025 Generation Adequacy Report* the importance of closely monitoring the conditions under which these shutdowns and restarts are implemented for the management of the power system.

## Recent Regulatory Changes

Several provisions have recently come into force for these installations, introducing production tolerances that ensure payment of the negative price premium to producers under the feed-in premium scheme¹ under more flexible conditions, in order to limit unintended side effects of this premium:

- **Production tolerance** when the day-ahead coupling price (spot price) is between €0 and -€0.10/MWh, or when the intraday price turns positive again;  
- **Production tolerance** during the first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes of each negative price period;  
- **Possibility to produce up to a minimum technical output level**, instead of fully shutting down the installation.

These changes, while maintaining the financial incentive for producers to stop production during negative spot price periods, facilitate improved balancing of their perimeter by balance responsible entities and aggregators. They also encourage shutdowns and restarts to occur as close as possible to the boundaries of the negative price episode, without being anticipated or extended.

## Implementation and Monitoring

Proper implementation of these new provisions by balance responsible entities and producers must now be a priority. These measures promote the efficient integration of supported renewable energy into electricity markets, for the benefit of balance responsible entities and the electricity transmission network.

As a balance responsible entity, you are a key player in implementing these provisions.

From 2026 onward, in agreement with the State and the regulator, RTE will carry out aggregated monitoring of the implementation of these new provisions by balance responsible entities and producers, and of their impact on the operation of the electricity system, notably within the Public Electricity Transmission Network Users Committee.

We ask that you inform your usual RTE contact of your level of preparedness and the extent to which these provisions have been integrated into your processes and contracts.

RTE’s teams remain at your disposal for any further information.
